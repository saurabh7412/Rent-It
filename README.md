This is an E-Commerce website which speciaizes in selling household products for all categories. The website provides 23,000 products of different types of products like furnitures, packages, appliances, fitness and WFH essentials, etc.

In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements using HTML and Javascript, styling using CSS and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With the self learning efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till Unit-3 in the Masai School, I was able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.


# Technology Stack Used ðŸŒŸ
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

For storing user data we also used localStorage , JSON-Server.

## How to run the Project
* Open pages directory.
* Open index.html .

## End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project I have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website images provided as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

## Limitations
Some parts of webpages are not responsive yet.
